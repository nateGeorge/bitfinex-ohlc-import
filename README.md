## bitfinex-ohlc-import

### Quickstart

`pipenv run python bitfinex/main.py --debug --candle_size=1m`

Candle sizes can currently be 1m or 5m for one and five minute bars.


A script that imports all historical OHLC data from the Bitfinex API and stores it in a local database.

The data has a 1-minute interval and can be used to carry out further in-depth analysis of market trends or backtest trading bots.

All possible symbols on bitfinex are gathered at the time of scraping based on their API. The import begins from the earliest possible trading date. The script can be invoked periodically (for example with a cronjob) to fetch the latest data. It automatically resumes from the latest saved date.

API rate limits are respected and will not be exceeded. The script retries fetching with an incremental backoff time, and continues to the next symbol after 3 failed attempts.



## Installation

The script can be run in a virtualenv (via pipenv) or by using the Docker. For local development the virtualenv is recommended. For production deployments the Docker image is recommended.

### virtualenv (pipenv)

You need the `sqlite3` library installed on your system. On macOS you can use homebrew: `brew install sqlite3`.

To install the development environment, clone the repo and run:

    $ pipenv install --dev

The `--dev` flag will install development tools such as `py.test`.

### Docker

You can build the Docker image with:

    $ docker build -t bitfinex .

The Docker image will not install development tools such as `py.test`.

## Usage

You can run the script with the following command:

    $ pipenv run python bitfinex/main.py --debug

Or if you prefer Docker:

    $ docker run --rm bitfinex python bitfinex/main.py --debug

The `--debug` flag will print detailed information for each request/response, which is very useful for debugging.

    $ pipenv run python bitfinex/main.py --debug

	2018-04-22 20:48:49,633 DEBUG    Fetched 288 candles

The script will import OHLC data for all symbols defined in the `symbols.json` file. If the import is started for the first time, the date defined in `symbols_trading_start_days.json` will be used as a starting point. Otherwise the database is queried for the last date and the import will continue from there on.

The data is saved in a file called `bitfinex.sqlite3` in the same directory as the script. You can change it by passing it as an argument:

    $ pipenv run python bitfinex/main.py /path/to/my/db.sqlite3

## Database schema

The data is stored in a Sqlite3 database and has a `"candles"` table with the following structure:

    symbol (the trading symbol e.g. btcusd)
    time (time in unix timestamp with milliseconds added)
    open
    close
    high
    low
    volume

Example output:

    $ sqlite3 bitfinex.sqlite3
    sqlite> select * from candles;
    btcusd|1366366980000|122.7|122.4|122.7|122.4|1
    btcusd|1366366920000|123.2|122.7|123.2|122.7|82.9
    btcusd|1366366800000|123.7|123.7|123.7|123.7|1.1

## Export to CSV

The data can easily be exported to CSV:

    $ sqlite3 bitfinex.sqlite3
    sqlite> .headers on
    sqlite> .mode csv
    sqlite> .output data.csv
    sqlite> SELECT * FROM candles;
    sqlite> .quit

The data will be in a file called `data.csv`.

## Testing

You need to have development dependencies installed (`pipenv install --dev`).

The tests are stored in the `tests` directory and can be run with py.test:

    $ pipenv run py.test tests/


## Pipenv
To upgrade all packages in pipenv do:
`pipenv update --outdated`

To install another package:
`pipenv install <packagename>`

To upgrade a package:
`pipenv upgrade <packagename>`


## Debugging
The best way to debug is to activate the pipenv environment:
`pipenv shell`
The run in ipython and set the debug statement on the line you want:
`ipython -i bitfinex/main.py`
Set this line where you want it to stop:
`import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()`
Then use 'continue' to move on, or other python commands as needed.
